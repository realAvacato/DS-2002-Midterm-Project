# DS-2002-Midterm-Project


I hope this works. I know I chose kind of a small data set, but I think everything still fits the requirements and I think I still demonstrated some of my database knowledge. I deleted a lot of my test code and code that didn't work.





I used mongoDB to host the employees table from a JSON. The connection string is mongodb+srv://root:gthgthgth@ds2002.20qvgzt.mongodb.net/test


I used my local file system to upload the dependents table from a CSV.
